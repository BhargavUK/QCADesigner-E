# QCADesigner-E
The QCADesigner-E (QD-E) is an extension of the QCADesigner version 2.0.3 of Konrad Walus [1]. It implements the estimation of the power dissipation of QCA circuits based on the works of Timler and Lent et al. [2-4]. The extension is integrated as an additional simulation module that is based on the Coherence Vector Simulation Engine (CVSE). Further, QD-E is fully compatible to QCA designs generated with the QCADesigner version 2.0.3
